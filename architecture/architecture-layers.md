# 📚 Federal Architecture Layers  
Layered breakdown of the Federal automation and orchestration system.

---

## 1. Overview  
This document describes the layered architecture used in the Federal automation platform. Each layer is isolated, modular, and designed for secure, repeatable operations.

---

## 2. Layer Breakdown  

### **2.1 Presentation Layer**  
- CLI and operator interfaces  
- Workflow triggers  
- Status dashboards (sanitized)  

### **2.2 Control Plane Layer**  
- Workflow orchestration  
- Policy enforcement  
- Configuration validation  
- Access control logic  

### **2.3 Execution Layer**  
- Python and PowerShell automation modules  
- Validation routines  
- Compliance checks  
- Environment provisioning tasks  

### **2.4 Configuration Layer**  
- Baseline configuration profiles  
- Environment-specific overrides  
- Sanitized operational parameters  

### **2.5 Data Layer**  
- Log storage  
- State tracking  
- Metadata collection  
- Audit artifacts  

### **2.6 Integration Layer**  
- API connectors  
- External system adapters  
- Secure communication channels

## 🧩 Architecture Layers

| Layer | Components | Function |
|-------|------------|----------|
| 🏛️ Federal Access Layer | IL4/IL5, GCC High, NSC | Provides compliance‑aligned access control for restricted federal environments |
| 🔑 Identity & MFA Layer | YubiKey, SSO, RBAC | Enforces strong authentication, identity assurance, and least‑privilege authorization |
| 🖥️ Endpoint & Platform Layer | VDI, ServiceNow, Windows | Delivers secure workstations and enterprise platforms within controlled enclaves |
| 📊 Audit & Compliance Layer | Logging, Monitoring | Ensures traceability, audit readiness, and continuous compliance reporting |

---

## 3. Layer Interaction Model  
- Presentation Layer interacts only with the Control Plane  
- Control Plane delegates tasks to the Execution Layer  
- Execution Layer reads from the Configuration Layer  
- Data Layer records all operational output  
- Integration Layer synchronizes results externally  

---

## 4. Security Considerations  
- Least-privilege execution  
- Immutable configuration baselines  
- Sanitized logging  
- Strict separation of operator and system roles
