# 🧱 Federal Support Architecture Overview

This document provides a high‑level overview of the secure access architecture used to support weekend operations within IL4/IL5 federal environments. It describes the layered structure that governs device compliance, identity enforcement, privileged access, and continuous monitoring across isolated federal enclaves.
The architecture incorporates MDM enrollment (Intune/Jamf), Zero Trust authentication workflows, hardware‑based MFA (YubiKey), secure gateway routing (Zscaler, GlobalProtect, Citrix), and endpoint security controls aligned with federal compliance standards. It also includes automated audit processes used to validate access events and maintain operational readiness during weekend support windows.
